Open Cart  1.X Installing Plug in

Installing an already ready extension is easy you just need to upload the extension xml file into:

your /vqmod/xml directory. By default after successful installation of vqmod there should be just one file there, called
"vqmod_opencart.xml" you should not touch it for any reason.

If you don't want to use anymore the extensions just remove the extensions's xml file from the /vqmod/xml directory
