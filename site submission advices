Submitting your website to search engines and directories is very important for your overall Search Engine Optimization (SEO). 
Below we have a list of some websites which offer submission to many search engines and directories you can begin with.
Some practical advises from us
- Create a new file and input your Website's title, description, keywords, email there so you will not need to type it everytime for a new submission but just copy it.
- Never use any personal emails you are going to use in the future. 
Just create one for the submitting purposes because in the email you are going to use when submitting will be send not only the confirmation of your submission but many advertising and spam emails you don't need.
Create email like john.smith@yourdomain.com so it looks like a email you are regularly using.
- Start the submission only after you have completly finished your website.
